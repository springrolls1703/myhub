- Project management.

# Module 2: Development processes and organizations.
## I. Development process
1. Basic Research: Discovery process, no set timing, unpredictable returns, longterm
2. Technology Development: loosely structured, difficult to plan, medium term, less predictable
3. Product Development: Structured methods, planned timing, predictable outcome, short terms.

***Summary***
1. Understand what each stages provides.
2. Know the various types of experts you will need in to include for successful R&D
3. Gain a strong understanding of milestones and how to manage projects.

## II. Development processes and organizations
Ultimate goal: Create value through product development
### Methodology:
1. Iterative Design: Quantified metrics, 
2. Non-ideal Conditions
3. Robust Design
4. User Experience mapping

### Concept development processes
Customer needs -> Target Specifications -> Generate Product Concepts -> Select Product Concepts -> Test PC -> Set final specs -> Plan downstream Development

Every steps need: Perform economic Analysis, Benchmark competitive products, build and test models and prototypes

***Summary***
- understand the concept development process
- generic product development process
- rapid iteration PD process
- complex system PD process

## III. Product development
1. Planning: Metrics, track everything ahead of time, research, everything needs to be quantifiable.
### Product Development process
2. Concept Development
3. System-Level Designs
4. Detail Designs
5. Training& Refinement
### End of product development process
6. Production Ramp Up

### Product Planning Process:
Opportunities -> Evaluate and prioritization -> Allocate Resouces -> Complete Pre-project Planning -> Product Development Process

### What do we prototype?
- Organizational Aspects: scale up and scale down
- Supply Chain: Adaption to geo, politics...
- Concept Development: 
- The integration of human and technology

Approach For Your Prototype:
- Break your Concept into phases and modules
- Start Broadly and capture all potential needs.
- Narrow down and prioritize

Know your audiences:
- Each audience for the prototype has different needs and attention spans
- who is your audiences? Investor, Users, Vendors and Distributors, Partners, Celebrity endorsement

## VI. The Customer Needs Process
### Part One:
1. Key Focus: The core Lines of Businesses
2. Value Proposition: Pains and gains, User experience understanding, hybrid business models, prototyping for hybrid business models

The customer Needs process
- Define the scope: Mission Statement
- Gather Raw Data: Interviews, Focus Group, Observation
- Interpret Raw Data: Needs Statement
- Organize the needs: Hierachy of needs
- Establish Importance: Surveys, Quantified Needs
- Reflect on the Process: Continous improvement

***Summary***
- Concept Development Process
- Define the Scope
- Know how to use the raw data
- Organize the Hierachy of needs
- Develop the mission statement
- Assumptions and Stakeholders

### Part Two:
Five Guidelines for writing Need Statement
Guideline: 
1. WHAT not HOW: The Screwdriver is protected from accidental shooting.
2. specificity: the screwdriver operates normally after repeated dropping.
3. POSITIVE not NEGATIVE: The screwdriver operates normally in the rain.
4. Attribute of the product: The screwdriver battery can be charged from an automobile cigarette lighter
5. Avoid "Must" and "Should": The screwdriver provides an indication of the energy level.


Caveats:
- Capture "what not how"
- Customer use environment
- Collect Visual, verbal, textual data.
- Props will simulate customer response.
- Interviews are more efficient than focus groups.
- Interviews all Stakeholders and lead Users
- Develop an organized list of need statement
- Looking for latent needs.
- Survey to quantify tradeoffs
- Make a video to communicate result.

Your Prototype and Audience:
- What are the priorities of different audiences
- Production price vs sale price, markups and ROIs.
- ROI vs. technology
- learning curve?
- Conflicting Investor and User priorities

Adapting your prototype
- Different audiences may require different prototypes
- Prototyping the supply chain. 
- User experience
- Hybrid prototype for resourcefulness.

***Summary***
- Product Development Process
- Guidelines for writing needs Statement
- Meet customer needs environment
- Collect verbal, visual, textual data.
- Develop an organized list of needs

## V. User Experience Overview
### Lean UX
1. A set of flexible developmental principles focuses on validating hypotheses => Accountability.
2. It includes a lot of pratices seen in Agile and user-centered design
3. Adds tool and strategies for startup

### Lean loop
Emphasize -> Define -> Ideate -> Prototype -> Test

### Lean UX is agile
- Agile Design includes cross-functional teams where designers and developer work together on the same product.
- Quickly in short cycle
- get rid of waterfall development
### Lean UX ix different
- not PM "done" for user story
- a feature is finished when it's shipped to the user
- a feature is simply a method of validating a user behavior is good or bad for business.

### Lean UX vs. Agile UX
- Lean UX: Build-Measure-Learn cycles, design united with business and development, inspired by startups
- Agile UX: Integrate UX and Agile methodology, UX designing and dev work together.

### Early Validation
- Early Proof of Concept
- Research methods for Early validating
- validate and invalidate your hypothesis
- Wireframes, sketches, interactive tools
- Save time by skipping higher fidelity design delieverables
- Drawbacks of paper prototyping

***Summary***
- Lean UX is both user centered and agile
- Validate concept
- for startups
- improve customer experience
- metrics are the heart

## VI. Diagrams, Sketches, Wireframes, and Prototypes
1. A Diagrams: simple interaction
for: Estimating time, not good for testing a hypotheses but good for internal use, diagram changes a lot.
2. Sketches:
for: Useful for thinking through problems, not good for UX interactivity, X is for experience
3. Wireframe:
A cross between sketches and functioning prototype. Content is critical
Don't overthink the aesthetic, focus on the UX.
4. Prototypes: figuring out where could go wrong, use an interactive prototype to save time and money.

## VII. Emerging Technologies and Your Concept
Emerging technologies are those not yet replacing current ones, potential to be disruptive, in prototyping
### Why should be aware:
1. technology could be rendered obsolete in few years.
2. newer technology can create new Opportunities for new adopters.
3. regulations works in favor or against
4. Open source movement
5. Licences and COTS

# Module 3: Concept Generation
Concept Generation process
Clarify the problem -> Search internally, externally -> explore systematically -> Reflect on the solutions and the process

***Summary***
- Understand the process
- Key customer Needs
