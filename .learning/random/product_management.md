# 1. Product discovery
*the purpose of product discovery is separate good and bad ideas*

Answering 4 critical question:
1. Will the user buy this (or choose to use it)?
2. Can the user figure out how to use this?
3. Can our engineer build this?
4. Can our stakeholders support this?

***strong team normally test 10-20 product ideas per week***

# 2. Product Vision
*this refers to the longer-term objective of this product, normally 2-10 years out, this is the company mission*

Minimum viable product (MVP): is an **important** term however the concept of MVP could be confused 

***should have been aiming for prototypes instead*** 

# 3. Product team
*we need team of Missionaries not Mercenaries*

Some basic roles in the team are: product manager, product marketing manager, data analyst, larger product organizations, a delivery manager.

`product manager is a boss of no one in the team`

# 4. Product Manager

2. Deep knowledge of the data
3. Deep knowledge of your business
4. Deep knowledge of your Market and Industry

Product manager vs product owner: product owner is the person responsible for product backlog

# 5. Product Designer
*Rather than being measured by the output of their design work, the product designer is measured on the success of the product*

Holistic User Experience Design: User Experience is much bigger than user interface. User Experience includes all the touch points and interactions a customer has with your product. Considering questions as:

- How will the customer first learn about the product?
- How will we onboard a first-time user and (perhaps gradually) reveal the new functionality?
- How might users interact at different times during the day?
- What other things are competing for the user's attention?
- How might things be different for a one-month-old customer?
- How will we motivate a user to a higher?
- How will we create moments of gratification?
- How will a user share his/her experience with others?
- How will customers receive an offline service?
- What is the perceived responsiveness of the product?

Product design is important, Apple is one of the most design-conscious company in the world. Once you get a product designer:
1. Do what ever you need to do to have your designer sit next to you
2. Include your designer from the very inception of every idea
3. Include your designer in as many customer and user interactions as possible. Learn about the users and customers together
4. Fight your temptation to provide your designer with your own design ideas. Give your designer as much room as possible to solve the design challenges him or herself.
5. Encourage your designer to iterate early and often.

`We need design - not just as a service to make our service beautiful - but to discover the right product`

# 6. Engineers
*There's probably no more important relationship for a successful product manager than the one with your engineers*

# 7. Product Marketing
*Modern product marketing managers represent the market to the product team—the positioning, the messaging, and a winning go-to-market plan. They are deeply engaged with the sales channel and know their capabilities, limitations, and current competitive issues*

# 8. Supporting roles

*User Researchers*
Qualitative and Quantitative
*Data Analyst*

- Google Adwords
- Problem of Cannibalism and User Experience might be affected
- instead of determining placement based solely on the price paid, they would use a formula that multiplied the price paid per impression with the ad’s performance (click-through-rate) to determineplacement,sothatthebest-performingads—theonesmost likely to be most relevant to users—would rise to the top, and the worst ads would be unlikely to be displayed at all.
