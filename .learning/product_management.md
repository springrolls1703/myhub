# 1. Product discovery
*the purpose of product discovery is separate good and bad ideas*

Answering 4 critical question:
1. Will the user buy this (or choose to use it)?
2. Can the user figure out how to use this?
3. Can our engineer build this?
4. Can our stakeholders support this?

***strong team normally test 10-20 product ideas per week***

# 2. Product Vision
*this refers to the longer-term objective of this product, normally 2-10 years out, this is the company mission*

Minimum viable product (MVP): is an **important** term however the concept of MVP could be confused 

***should have been aiming for prototypes instead*** 

# 3. Product team
*we need team of Missionaries not Mercenaries*

Some basic roles in the team are: product manager, product marketing manager, data analyst, larger product organizations, a delivery manager.

`product manager is a boss of no one in the team`

# 4. Product Manager
*product manager should be among the strongest talent in the company. Every business depends on customers. And what customers buy - or choose to use - is your product*
1. Deep knowledge of the customer: their issues, pains, desires, how they think.
2. Deep knowledge of the data
3. Deep knowledge of your business
4. Deep knowledge of your Market and Industry

*smart, creative, persistent*
