# Week 1: Introduction
## 1. Agile Systems and Resilience
- Predictive (Packed schedule, cost-efficient) 
- Robust (rebundant system, to-do list)
- Buffered (protected system, prioritized to-do list)
- Agile (Anti-fragile, replicated system, experimentation)

### Agile comparision:
- Agile: prioritize speed, adjusting scope, based on trust
- Traditional: Predicability, adjusting budget, efficiency
- Lean: Innovation, adjusting Schedule, expertise

### Agile manifesto
- individuals and interaction
- customer collaboration
- working system
- responding to change


## 2. Traditional & Lean – 1970s & 80s
### Issues with waterfall:
- Failure in physical systems are gradual
- Failure mode of software are all or nothing
- emergent behavior result
- a truly "wicked" problem

### Toyota way:
- think long-term
- right process produces right results
- add value by developing people
- continously solve problems

### big batches
- one process works, the other waits
- total processing time = item * total steps * avg time

### small batches
- first item is completed in just 1/n amount of time
- time = total steps * avg time

## 3. System Innovation – 1990s
- Understand the system
- Most system

A project exists to deliver benefits
- What: new buyers capilities
- How: lifecycle cost of a product or a service
- Why: net benefits of capabilities

Evaluate ROI:
- Set objectives
- Baseline performance
- Measure performance

Bottleneck:
- Identify the constraint
- Exploit the constraint
- Subordinate and syncronize the constraint
- Elevate the performance of the constraint
- Repeate

Agilists use multiple multiple planning, called "Rolling Wave"
- Long term, low detail
- Short term, high detail

Prioritizing scope to reduce the cost of delay

***Summary***
- System thinking
- Who is the customer
- Cost of delay
- Find the bottleneck
- Use focusing steps to optimize
- Execute the rolling Wave plans

## 4. Design Thinking & DevOps – 2000s
Low or no reuse of components means a "decoupled" design
- Small changes have small costs
- can release single features quickly

Design thinking
- Empathy
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test

Stanford's Principles of Design Thinking
- Humanity rule - all design is a social process
- Ambiguity Rule - it's okay not to know, just get started
- Re-design rule - nothing is new, just re-design with new tool and context
- Tangigbility rule - making things tangible faciliates communication

***Summary***
- Anti-fragile is biological
- Agile replaces in small patches
- Devops enables speed at scale
- Freedom and responsibility
- A little peril aligns the system
- Ask, don't tell customers for opinions
- Test everything with Devops

## 5. Business Agility – 2010s
RPV framework explains how businesses cannot escape disruption:
- Resources: people
- process: way of work
- value: how you make decision

Customer Development
value + customer hypotheses, business hyptheses, growth hypotheses
- Customer discovery: problem-solution fit, propose MVP, propose funnels
- Customer Validation: product market fit, business model, sales and marketing
- Customer creation: Sales execution
- Company building: Scale organization, scale operation

3 types of portfolio mangement model
- New product: Customer development
- existing product: Design Thinking
- supporting processes: Poogi

# Week 2: Devops Principles and Business Agility
## 1. Examples of Business Agility
- IBM: complex system
- StarBuck: consummables/ retail
- Apple: consumer electronics
- Others: Huyndai

Twelve Types of Innovation
- Product leadership: disruption (new technology, new operation to the market: cheaper, more convenient), application/ solution, product (features and functions), platform
- Customer intimacy: Line extension, enhancement, marketing, experiential
- Operational exellence: Value Engineering, integration, process, value migration
## 2. Principles and Ideas for DevOps and Business Agility
Work is people's serving others need:
- Internal customers
- external customers
- end consumers (ultimate customers)

Deliver with experimental and learning
- Customer Development
- Design thinking

The three ways: Devops Business principles:
1. First way system thinking:
- Understand the whole system, make work visible
- Optimize for the whole, by increasing flow
- Do not pass defects down stream
2. Second way - Amplify feed back loop:
- speed up & incentivize feedback for continous improvement
- respond to customers internal and external
3. Third way - Culture of experiementation and learning
- reward risk taking with a framework
- inject failure to learn how to recover
- buy down technical debt
## 3. DevOps Technology
5 Ideals of Work
1. Locality and simplicity
2. Focus, Flow and Joy
3. improvement of daily work
4. spychological safty
5. Customer focus

### Release on Demand from Scaled Agile Framework
- "Develop on Cadence, Release on Demand" - SAFe Mantra
- Features are developed via a cadence of agile sprints
- Features can then be tested and released based on marketing

Require four activities and capilities in the product:
1. Release
2. Stabilize and operate
3. Measure
4. learn

## 4. Lean Startup Analytics
Business projects:
- Product risk (usability, feasability)
- Market Metrics (Growth metrics, demand overtime)

Operation projects:
- Speed of delivery
- System Performance
- Team Health

Changes
- Number, type, and cost of changes

Unplanned work
- Number and type of defects (severity, frequency, resolution time)

### Guide to metrics
Good metrics
- Understandable
- Comparable
- A ratio or rate
- Behavior changing

Data Types:
- Qualitative
- Quantitative

Types of metrics:
- Lagging and leading
- Explatory and reporting

Identify a metric that is leading indicator of future success:
- Logically based on user experience
- Derived based on product requirements
- Statistically based on existing Data

Generate a hypotheses about how to improve the leading indicator

Run tests to validate

Track progress

- Customer Hypotheses: Do they have a need?
- Value Hypotheses: Will they use it, will they buy it
- Growth Hypotheses/ Engine: Paid, Sticky,Viral

## 5. System Optimization with Open Architectures

1. Consider buyer's system
2. A system could be:
- a consumer commuting to work
- an organization that serves clients
3. Most systems are limited by constraints

POOGI - Process of On-going improvement

1. Identify the constraints
2. Exploit the constraint
3. Subordinate & Syncronize to the constraint
4. Elevate the performance of the constraint
5. Repeat the process

Five Levers of Resouces attraction

1. Centralize - put operations under one controller
2. Standardize - reduce variability and deliver with quality
3. Modularize - standardize interfaces and break into subsystems
4. optimize - automation, reduce redundancies
5. oursources

# Week 3: Data sciences for risk 
1. Start with an insight
2. Design powerful experiment
3. Gather data to guide the organizational strategy
4. Repeat and continue to grow with validated learning cycles

## Data Science pipeline

1. Intellect and Intuitive: framing start with intuition, requires a mental model of the world
2. MOP VAR - mop the variable: model, organize, process, visualize, analyze, routinize

***Reality -> Raw data collected -> Data is processed -> Clean Data -> Exploratory Data Analysis -> Model Algorithms -> Communicate Visualized product/ Data product -> Make decisions and reality***

- Economics Data: Department of Commerce, BLS, IBISWorld
- GIS Mashups:  ESRI's Open Data Hub, OpenStreetmap, POI Factory

1. Business Accounting: This data is usually highly accurate, actual activities
2. CRM: client histories, marketing and sales can capture this data.
3. Other functional System data: system operations, special projects, marketing

## Capturing Data bout market:
1. Generative: 
- Market-who/what how about customer: Customer Discovery Interview/ Data mining/ Contextual Inquiry/ Focus Groups and Survey
- Product-Features, Costs, priority: Solution Interview, Demo pitch, Coneirge Test/ Consulting, Picnic in the Graveyard

2. Evaluative: 
- Market-willingness to pay? Cost to deliver: 5 seconds tests/ Conjoint Analysis/ Smoke Tests/ Data Mining
- Product-Does the product really work: Paper Prototypes, Wizard of Oz, Product Analysis

## Prototypes and Data Types

- 2 groups of hypotheses: product innovation, customer innovation
- Must know your data theory
- quantiative and qualitative

Customer innovation: Customer to product.
- Concierge test - do the job for them
- Customer misbehavior - encourage misuse
- Hack days: 
- Prototypes Feasibility (PoC, new tech), User prototype, Live data
- Demand testing

Varible:
- Categorical: Nominal (Truth), Ordinal (priorities)
- Quantiative: Interval (Impact), ratio (Total)

1. Interview
- Customer Interview
- Solution Interview
2. Usability
- Recruit, prep, test, learn
3. Specific value test
- Demand test and value test
4. Iterating the prototype

## Data Prep Technique
MOP VAR: model, organize, visualize, analyze, routinize

1. Basics: 
- Raw data: original data as gathered or measured
- Tidy data: cleaned, organized with variables as columns and observations as row
- Data history: how your data is transform.
- Codebook: description of data

Data Structures:
- Structured
- Semi-structured
- Unstructured

Data -> Data Lake -> Process -> Datawarehouse

### Data Lake vs Data warehouse:
Data warehouse:
- Structured, processed
- shcema-on-write
- expensive for large volume
- less agile, fix configuration
- Security: Mature
- for DA

Data lake:
- Structured, semi-structured, unstructured, raw
- Schema-on-read
- designed for low costs
- highly agile
- Maturing in security
- For DS


### Profile and CITE process

1. Profile: Error detection - scatter, histogram, outliners
2. Clean: Data Quality - value correction, normalizing, formatting, splitting, merging, record classification, variable screening.
3. Integrate: Combine Datasets
4. Transform: Generate observations and Derive New Variables 
5. Extract: Extract observations and variables for analysis.

## Data Analysis follows the Prep Cycle:
- EDA
- Visualization Techniques - Data Mashups
- Descriptive Statistics
- Differences and Inferences: T-Test, One and Two-way (M)ANOVA, Logistic Regression (Predict binary outcomt - yes or no), Linear (Multiple) Regression, Factor analysis identifies groups of variables that form a critical "factor" together.
- SaaS: Optimizely, GA, Omniture
- Devops: Features toggles/ Split channels or Landing Pages, In-house Traffic Splitting

# Week 4: Data-Driven Controls with Technology and Teams
## 1. Powering the Flywheel with OKRs

Empirical truths on strategic management
1. BHAGs - big, hairy audacious goals that create a mission.
2. Hedgehogs - companies focus on doing onething well.
3. Flyweels - a series of strategic objectives that grow and sustain company core advantage

### It's all about customer: 
- Inspired (Cagan): problem roadmap not product roadmap
- Build Trap: It's about the output not the outcome.
- Measure what matters: objectives and key results.

Flyweel acts as a guide for setting objectives
- Flyweel are the core differentiators
- Set the innovation type
- Objectives set a measurable outcome that's timebound.
- Objectives over-time equals speed of turning the flyweel


Objectives: 
- Meaningful
- Audacious
- Inspiring
Key Results are SMART

Types of OKRs:
- Committed: 100% will be meet
- Aspirational - 30-70% will be meet
- Learning - goal is to learn.

KRs:
- Input, Output, Outcome.
- Pairing Quality with Quantity
- Hold, Increment, Leap.

Scaling type:
- Directive - OKRs are cascaded
- Directional - OKRs are shared publicly
- 50% should be bottom ups

1. OKR planning:
- Quarterly Cycle
- Q1 includes anual
2. 4 - 6 weeks out:
- Brainstorms OKRs
3. Quarterly Planning
- Share OKRs with company
- Team share OKRs
- Employees share OKRs (1-week after)
4. Track progress
- Track KRs for progress
- Share monthly confidence level.

Reflect & Score near the end of the Quarter


## 2. Defining Product Strategies
Small product team achieve OKRs
- reducing the increments to drive feedback
- focus on one OKRs at a time.
- reduce dependencies between OKRs.
- stay focus on business value. What is the MVP?

### Integrated teams vs. Independent team.

## 3. Highly Aligned Teams Video
- Initiating: sometimes the first sprint is used for long range planning activities
- Hardening
- Escalation
- WIP limits
- Testing and Defects

### Controls that Align Products

Goal of product control is to:
- Facilitate and optimize product lifecycle
- Enable scaling and sustainability of products

6 elements:
- Planning: Information model, forecasting, design factors, design buffers.
- Designing: prototypes, standards, templates
- Building: Materials, Architecture, Standards, Constraints.
- Testing: Test Scripts, Automated Test
- Closing: Standard, Acceptance Criteria, Approvals
- Reporting: Information models, story points, customer experience, user stories.

Definition of Done: 
- Standard Approvals
- Review by stakeholders
- Prototyping
- Documentation
- Design constraints

Sponsors own objectives and are accountable for:
- ensuring portfolio alignment
- defining standards & integration
- driving stakeholder involvement

Product owner: Own the backlog
- A complete, ready backlog for each sprint
- Incoperate stakeholder input and concerns

Team owns the work and sprint goals
- Functionality and quality
- Meeting commitments to deliver on-time.

Agile PM: overall performance.

## Optimizing the Product Backlog

### Optimal batches depend on
- Available industry technology
- level of project uncertainty
- Time and cost to integrate across teams
- Benefits to your buyer of a release

### Managing Portfolio Require:
1. Really good data quality
2. Realistic and tested models
3. Sustainability and scale considerations
4. Algorithm to rapidly find a solution.

Maximizing returns:
1. Knapsack algorithm
