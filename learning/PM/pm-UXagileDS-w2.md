### End of product development process
6. Production Ramp Up

### Product Planning Process:
Opportunities -> Evaluate and prioritization -> Allocate Resouces -> Complete Pre-project Planning -> Product Development Process

### What do we prototype?
- Organizational Aspects: scale up and scale down
- Supply Chain: Adaption to geo, politics...
- Concept Development: 
- The integration of human and technology

Approach For Your Prototype:
- Break your Concept into phases and modules
- Start Broadly and capture all potential needs.
- Narrow down and prioritize

Know your audiences:
- Each audience for the prototype has different needs and attention spans
- who is your audiences? Investor, Users, Vendors and Distributors, Partners, Celebrity endorsement

## VI. The Customer Needs Process
### Part One:
1. Key Focus: The core Lines of Businesses
2. Value Proposition: Pains and gains, User experience understanding, hybrid business models, prototyping for hybrid business models

The customer Needs process
- Define the scope: Mission Statement
- Gather Raw Data: Interviews, Focus Group, Observation
- Interpret Raw Data: Needs Statement
- Organize the needs: Hierachy of needs
- Establish Importance: Surveys, Quantified Needs
- Reflect on the Process: Continous improvement

***Summary***
- Concept Development Process
- Define the Scope
- Know how to use the raw data
- Organize the Hierachy of needs
- Develop the mission statement
- Assumptions and Stakeholders

### Part Two:
Five Guidelines for writing Need Statement
Guideline: 
1. WHAT not HOW: The Screwdriver is protected from accidental shooting.
2. specificity: the screwdriver operates normally after repeated dropping.
3. POSITIVE not NEGATIVE: The screwdriver operates normally in the rain.
4. Attribute of the product: The screwdriver battery can be charged from an automobile cigarette lighter
5. Avoid "Must" and "Should": The screwdriver provides an indication of the energy level.


Caveats:
- Capture "what not how"
- Customer use environment
- Collect Visual, verbal, textual data.
- Props will simulate customer response.
- Interviews are more efficient than focus groups.
- Interviews all Stakeholders and lead Users
- Develop an organized list of need statement
- Looking for latent needs.
- Survey to quantify tradeoffs
- Make a video to communicate result.

Your Prototype and Audience:
- What are the priorities of different audiences
- Production price vs sale price, markups and ROIs.
- ROI vs. technology
- learning curve?
- Conflicting Investor and User priorities

Adapting your prototype
- Different audiences may require different prototypes
- Prototyping the supply chain. 
- User experience
- Hybrid prototype for resourcefulness.

***Summary***
- Product Development Process
- Guidelines for writing needs Statement
- Meet customer needs environment
- Collect verbal, visual, textual data.
- Develop an organized list of needs

## V. User Experience Overview
### Lean UX
1. A set of flexible developmental principles focuses on validating hypotheses => Accountability.
2. It includes a lot of pratices seen in Agile and user-centered design
3. Adds tool and strategies for startup

### Lean loop
Emphasize -> Define -> Ideate -> Prototype -> Test

### Lean UX is agile
- Agile Design includes cross-functional teams where designers and developer work together on the same product.
- Quickly in short cycle
- get rid of waterfall development
### Lean UX ix different
- not PM "done" for user story
- a feature is finished when it's shipped to the user
- a feature is simply a method of validating a user behavior is good or bad for business.

### Lean UX vs. Agile UX
- Lean UX: Build-Measure-Learn cycles, design united with business and development, inspired by startups
- Agile UX: Integrate UX and Agile methodology, UX designing and dev work together.

### Early Validation
- Early Proof of Concept
- Research methods for Early validating
- validate and invalidate your hypothesis
- Wireframes, sketches, interactive tools
- Save time by skipping higher fidelity design delieverables
- Drawbacks of paper prototyping

***Summary***
- Lean UX is both user centered and agile
- Validate concept
- for startups
- improve customer experience
- metrics are the heart

## VI. Diagrams, Sketches, Wireframes, and Prototypes
1. A Diagrams: simple interaction
for: Estimating time, not good for testing a hypotheses but good for internal use, diagram changes a lot.
2. Sketches:
for: Useful for thinking through problems, not good for UX interactivity, X is for experience
3. Wireframe:
A cross between sketches and functioning prototype. Content is critical
Don't overthink the aesthetic, focus on the UX.
4. Prototypes: figuring out where could go wrong, use an interactive prototype to save time and money.

## VII. Emerging Technologies and Your Concept
Emerging technologies are those not yet replacing current ones, potential to be disruptive, in prototyping
### Why should be aware:
1. technology could be rendered obsolete in few years.
2. newer technology can create new Opportunities for new adopters.
3. regulations works in favor or against
4. Open source movement
5. Licences and COTS

# Module 3: Concept Generation
Concept Generation process
Clarify the problem -> Search internally, externally -> explore systematically -> Reflect on the solutions and the process

- make analogy
- wish and wonder
- solve the conflict
- trade ideas 

## II. Concept Selection
The needs of concept selections:
- Cost
- Several options to choose
- is an intergral part

### Methods of choosing a concept
1. External Decision
- Turn over the decision making.
2. Product Champion
- Influential member chooses based on personal preference
3. Intuition
- Chosen by its "feel". It just "feel" better. No metrics are used.
4. Web-based survey: Online survey tool. 
5. Pros and Cons: 
6. Prototypes and test
7. Decision matrices

### Benefits of a structured method

***Summary***
- Customer Needs are subjective
- Specifications are objective and precise
- House of quality
- Target Costing

## IV. Establishing Target Specifications
### 4 steps
1. Prepare a list of metrics (should be complete, dependent varibles, Pratical)   
2. Collect competitive benchmarking information (compare metrics from competing product)
3. Set ideal and marginally acceptable target value. 
4. Reflect on results. 

## V. Setting the Final Specifications
5 steps process
1. Develop technical models of the product
2. Develop a cost model of the product
3. Refine specifications
4. Flow down the specifications
5. Reflect on the results and process

# Module 4: Industrial Design
## I. Overview
Three challenges: People Desirable, Business viable, Technical feasible.

Industrial Design (Dreyfus, 1967)
- Utility: User interfaces should be safe, easy and intuitive, each feature is shaped to communicate its function.
- Appearance: form, line, color, and proportion
- Ease of maintenance: Designed to communicate how the are to be maintained.
- Low cost: form and features must be considered jointly.
- Communication: communicate the corperate desgin through visual qualities 

***Summary***
- EU and US ID
- Assessing the need for ID
- Technology vs. User

## II. Industrial Design Process
1. Investigation of customer Needs
2. Conceptiualization
3. Preliminary refinement
4. Further refinement and final concept selection
5. Control drawings or models
6. Coordination with engineering and external vendors.

## III. Industrial Design Needs Considerations
1. Ergonomic Needs
- How importance is ease of use? (frequently use and infrequently use products, challenging of several functions)
- How importance is ease of maintenance?
- How many user interactions are required for product's functions? (ideally as few as possible)
- How novel are the user interactions need? 
- What are the safety issues?

2. Aesthetic needs
- Is visual product differentiation required?
- How important are pride of owndership, image, and fashion?
- Will an aesthetic product motivate the team? (Team pride)

The impact of Industrial Design
- Direct Costs (Usually ID costs 75-300USD per hour), manufacturing costs and time cost
- Benefits include: increased product appeal => higher customer satisfaction

***Summary***
- Understands Customer Needs
- Corperate Identity
- Aesthetics
- Ergonomic

## IV. Design for the environment
What is DFE?
- A method to minimize or eliminate the environmental impact
- An effective DFE practice maintain or improve product quality and cost
- Life Cycles Assessment (LCA): quantify environemtal impact over product life cycle

Design for the Environment Process
- Considered Earth as a closed system with limited solar inputed and natural bio cycles
- balance the rate of the earth create resources
- solar and other renewable are sustainable
- toxic watse must be eliminated cus not part of Cycles

1. Product planning: DFE agenda
2. Concept Development: Identify potential impact, select material DFE Guidelines
3. System-Level Design: Apply DFE guidlines for initial design.
4. Detail design: assess impact, compare to goals, refinement
5. Process improvement: Reflect on DFE result.

Four rules:
1. material that can be recycled continually
2. natural materials that can be fully returned to the earth's natural cycle.
3. do not produce unnatural toxic material.
4. clean, renewable sources of energy.
