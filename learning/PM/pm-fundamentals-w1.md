# What product managers do?
Product managers are responsible for ***guiding the success of a product and leading the cross-functional team that is responsible for improving it.*** It is an important role, especially in technology companies, that sets the strategy, roadmap, and feature definition for a product or product line. The position may also include marketing, forecasting, and profit and loss (P&L) responsibilities. In many ways, the role of a product manager is similar in concept to a brand manager at a consumer packaged goods company.
